## Features

- **Data Extraction:** TeckyBot fetches content from specified URLs using the `requests` library and extracts text using `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Vector Database Creation:** It creates a vector database using the extracted text and saves it locally using `FAISS`.
- **Question Answering:** Users can input queries, and TeckyBot generates answers based on the provided content using a pre-trained language model (GooglePalm) and a retrieval-based question answering system.
- **User Interface:** The application interface is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive experience for users.
